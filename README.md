# TrackTuner
For SSW 590 Final Project

"TrackTuner" is a web app that helps users discover new music based on their favorite artists or songs through the Spotify API. Users can interact with their favorite tracks and playlists, create new ones, and explore music recommendations. The application utilizes a robust, hybrid CI/CD pipeline that leverages GitHub Actions for automation, integrates with Docker for container orchestration, and uses AWS Lambda for serverless deployment. This setup enables seamless deployment of both containerized applications and serverless functions, ensuring efficient and flexible scaling. The pipeline includes automation to maintain optimal performance and reliability throughout the development and deployment process.
